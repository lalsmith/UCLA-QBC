# Load libraries
library('igraph')# library for network analysis

# load data
iris=iris # this data is already in the computer's memory, but this line will show it in your 'environment' window 

# look at the data
head(iris) # shows the first 6 lines of the data frame
unique(iris$Species) # shows all the species (won't repeat)

# get the subset data from two species
setosa=iris[iris$Species=='setosa',] ## assign only the rows that belong to setosa and all the columns in the data frame to a variable named "setosa" (asking for all rows that have to do with setosa, and the comma has nothing after it so all the columns)
virginica=iris[iris$Species=='virginica',] ## assign only the rows that belong to virginica and all the columns in the data frame to a variable named "virginica"

# plot the sepal lengths of  setosa and virginica
quartz() # opens the figure in a new window. use the command quartz() for macs
par(mar=c(4, 4, 3, 2)) # set the margins

# comparing means of more than two groups
# plot all three species
quartz() # open a new figure window
plot(iris$Species, iris$Sepal.Length, # data to plot
     ylab="Sepal Length", # label axes
     col=c("hotpink", "plum", "cornflowerblue"), las=1, cex.axis=1.5,cex.lab=1.5) # make figure pretty

# are these three statistically different?
# run an ANOVA:
anova1=aov(iris$Sepal.Length~iris$Species) # set up the statistical test
summary(anova1) # look at the results of the statistical test
TukeyHSD(anova1) # examine each pair using a Tukey test (checks which ones are different from eachother, which is different from which)

## Add the results of the Tukey test to the plot:
quartz() # open a new figure window
plot(iris$Species, iris$Sepal.Length,ylab="Sepal Length", # data to plot and label axes
     ylim=c(4,10), # set the y limits to make space for stats test results (for letters)
     col=c("hotpink", "plum", "cornflowerblue"), las=1, cex.axis=1.5,cex.lab=1.5) # make figure pretty
# after you call plot you can add a various graphical features: 
# add letters above the boxes
text(c(1,2,3),c(9,9,9), # set the location of the letters (first c is x coord, second is y coord)
     c('A','B','C'), # set which letters to display  on the plot
     cex=2) # make sure they are large enough to read
## add a legend to the plot:
legend(2,10, # set the location x, y 
       unique(iris$Species), # text to display (calls all the names)
       text.col=c("hotpink", "plum", "cornflowerblue"), #text color
       bty ='n') # remove outline of legend box
# and just for fun...
# add circles  around the letters
points(c(1,2,3),c(9,9,9), # location of circles
       cex=10) # size of circles (default of points is empty circles - look up  in your R reference card what other shapes you can set using pch= )

## are sepal and petal length correlated?
# let's plot these first
quartz() # set a new figure
plot(iris$Petal.Length,iris$Sepal.Length, # data to plot 
     xlab='Petal length',ylab='Sepal length', # label your axes
     pch=16,las=1,cex.axis=1.5,cex.lab=1.5) # make the figure pretty

# run a Pearson's correlation test to see if traits are statistically correlated:
cor.test(iris$Petal.Length,iris$Sepal.Length)
cor_S_P<-cor.test(iris$Petal.Length,iris$Sepal.Length) #to save as something else if you want
## let's color code by species
# set a vector with a different  color for each species that matches their order in the data frame
cols=sub('setosa',"hotpink",iris$Species) # change setosa to hotpink in iris$Species, new variables
cols=sub('versicolor',"plum",cols)
cols=sub('virginica',"cornflowerblue",cols)

## another shorter way:
cols2=c("hotpink", "plum", "cornflowerblue")[unclass(iris$Species)]

# plot the correlation with color codes by species
quartz()
plot(iris$Petal.Length,iris$Sepal.Length, xlab='Petal length',ylab='Sepal length', # same as above...
     col=cols, # add color
     pch=16,las=1,cex.axis=1.5,cex.lab=1.5) # same as above
# add a legend:
legend("topleft", legend=unique(iris$Species), text.col=c("hotpink", "plum", "cornflowerblue"),pch=16, col=c("hotpink", "plum", "cornflowerblue"))

# is there a significant effect of species on the relationship between sepal and petal length?
# set up a linear model with both petal length and species as effects: (linear model is lm)
fit_with_sp=lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length + Species - 1, data=iris)
summary(fit_with_sp) # look at the results

# add an interaction term: (whether each species has a different slope, change + to a *) (tilde means: is a function of)
fit_with_sp_with_int=lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length * Species - 1, data=iris)
summary(fit_with_sp_with_int)
